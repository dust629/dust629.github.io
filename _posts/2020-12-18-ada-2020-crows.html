        <h1>A global picture of the EV market</h1>
         <i><font color="grey">Tiny share yet impressive growth!</font></i>
         <p> According to the IEA, only around <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">17 000</a> electric vehicles (EV) were on the road globally in 2010. 
            In 2019 this number climbed up to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020">4.79 million</a>! That is more than a steady 180% increase year-on-year! 
            Yet, globally, there are more than <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world-70629">1 billion</a>  cars in use which makes the EV fleet less than half a percent. 
            Still, this impressive growth over the past 10 years raises big questions for the future. 
            When will electric surpasses combustion vehicles? Which EV model is selling best? Can gas stations switch to charging stations at the same pace? 
            What does it take to accelerate or decelerate this transition? Which countries are ahead in EV deployments? </p>
            <p>Well, it turns out that there are humongous disparities in the growth of EVs across the globe. Take a look at 2018 car sales. Look at how Norway is way ahead in EV sales share!  
            </p>

         <h1>Closer look at Norway</h1>
            <i><font color="grey">Secret recipe to EV fertility</font></i>
            <p>Such a feet in respect of global performance raises questions on how it can be achieved. First and foremost, lets look at the top EV models sold in Norway.</p>
            <iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~shasha.jiang/15.embed"></iframe>
            <P>Nissan Leaf started 10 years ago so it benefits from the top spot compared to the notorious Tesla model 3 which made its debuts a year ago (only!). 
               It is obvious that there must be a reason behind these numbers. 
               Are Norwegians extremely concerned about the environment? 
               Well not more than their neighbour countries (Greta is not Norwegian). 
               Additionally, Norway is the EU member which produces the most petrol in Europe! So what is the secret? Well ... </P>
            <i><center>Pricetag!</center></i>
            <p>When it comes down to choosing a new car, EVs are still significantly more expensive with respect their fossil fuel counterparts. 
               But thanks to government policies this does not have to be the case everywhere. 
               Indeed, at the time where quasi no EVs could be found on the roads, a whole series of government policies were set in place in Norway. 
               The most significant two were:</p>
               <ul type="square">
                  <li>1991: The <b>“one time fee”</b> roughly doubled the price of each car except EVs</li>
                  <li>2001: A <b>VAT exemption</b> was allocated to EVs</li>
               </ul>
            <p>Yet with all these measures, it took another 10 years until the EV growth started to kick in. 
               And compared to the rest of the world, this fleet share growth is simply put, jaw dropping. </p>

         <h1>Let’s start digging </h1>
            <i><font color="grey">Python is our favourite shovel</font></i>
            <p>The plot above raises some interesting concerns. What triggered the sudden growth of EV sales in Norway and what sustains it? 
               Lets start by analysing the consumer behaviour in respect to switching from dirty gasoline to “clean” electric into four categories which can directly influence their choice. </p>
            <body>

            </body>
            <p>Now that we have these categories, how do we assess which category affects the most the decision of consumers? </p>
            <h1>Google trends</h1>
            <i>Google never lies</i>
            <p>Why not investigate what consumers search for on the web before they buy an electric vehicle? 
               The idea will be to investigate search patterns within these four categories and align them Norway’s EV market share. 
               A Google has a ready made tool for that ! </p>
               <i><center>Google trends</center></i>
            <p>You can narrow historical data of search queries to a specific timespan and region. Up to 5 keywords can be compared among each other. 
               The values are on a scale of 0 to 100% where 100% is the data point for which a single keyword has been the most solicitated. 
               We have selected 5 keywords which, in our eyes, represent most the categories mentioned above. 
               The trends of these keywords are shown here. </p>
